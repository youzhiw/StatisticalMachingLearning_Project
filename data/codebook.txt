The c_readindata is a stored python object. You will need the following code to read it:

def retrieveVariables(filename):
    variables = []
    with open(str(filename), 'rb') as file:
        variables = pickle.load(file)
    return variables

wdir = "./" #working directory

[envelop_signal, sPmP_time, sPmP_label, 
 dist, evdp, mag, stlo, 
 stla, evlo, evla, evid, 
 fname] = retrieveVariables(f"{wdir}/data/c_readindata")

Below is what each of the variables respresent:

`envelop_signal` A smooth curve outline the extremes of the seismic wave

`sPmP_time` Arrival time of the sPmP wave

`sPmP_label` Indication of whether the wave has a good sPmP signal, 0 for bad, 1 for good.

`dist` Distance of the seismic event in relation to the seismic station that recorded the waveform.

`evdp` The depth of the seismic event that the waveform is from.

`mag` The magnitude of the seismic event (Earthquake).

`stlo` The longitude of the seismic station.

`stla` The latitude of the seimic sation

`evlo` The longitude of the seismic event.

`evla` The latitude of the seismic event.

`evid` Event ID, a unique identifier for the seismic event.

`fname` Filename that stored all the above information. The Filename is formatted as Time of the seismic event concatenated with the seismic station that recorded the waveform.
